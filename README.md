######  ABSTRACT
Here, we develop an audiovisual deep residual network for multimodal apparent personality trait recognition. The network is trained end-to-end for predicting the Big Five personality traits of people from their videos. That is, the network does not require any feature engineering or visual analysis such as face detection, face landmark alignment or facial expression recognition. Recently, the network won the third place in the [ChaLearn First Impressions Challenge @ ECCV2016][1] with a test accuracy of 0.9109.
